## 🔧 For Platform Administrators

**Set up complete infrastructure for DevOps teams**

You're responsible for configuring SageMaker Unified Studio projects and managing the platform.

→ **[Admin Quick Start](admin-quickstart.md)** (15-20 minutes)

**What you'll learn:**
- Create projects for dev/test/prod
- Configure connections and resources
- Set up monitoring and alerts
