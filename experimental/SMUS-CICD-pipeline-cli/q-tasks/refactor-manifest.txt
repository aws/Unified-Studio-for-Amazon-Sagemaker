# Refactor Manifest Task - Terminology Change

## Objective
Clarify terminology to distinguish between:
- **Bundle**: The manifest definition (what gets deployed - workflows, code, dependencies)
- **GitHub Workflows**: The CICD pipeline automation (how deployment happens)
- **CICD Pipeline**: Refers specifically to GitHub workflows, not our manifest

## Current Problem
The term "pipeline" is overloaded:
- Our manifest is called "pipeline manifest" but it's really a "bundle definition"
- GitHub workflows are the actual CICD pipeline
- This creates confusion about what owns what

## Terminology Changes Required

### Core Concept
- OLD: "pipeline manifest" → NEW: "bundle manifest" or just "bundle"
- OLD: "CICD pipeline" (referring to our tool) → NEW: "GitHub workflows" (be specific)
- KEEP: "CICD pipeline" only when referring to GitHub Actions workflows

### Files to Change

#### 1. Documentation Files
- `docs/pipeline-manifest.md` → rename to `docs/bundle-manifest.md`
- `docs/pipeline-manifest-schema.md` → rename to `docs/bundle-manifest-schema.md`
- `docs/cli-commands.md` - update all references
- `README.md` - update terminology
- All example README files

#### 2. Schema Files
- `src/smus_cicd/pipeline/pipeline-manifest-schema.yaml` → `bundle-manifest-schema.yaml`
- Update schema title and descriptions

#### 3. Python Code
- `src/smus_cicd/pipeline/pipeline_manifest.py` → rename to `bundle_manifest.py`
- Update class names: `PipelineManifest` → `BundleManifest`
- Update all docstrings and comments
- CLI help text in `src/smus_cicd/cli.py`
- Update all imports across codebase

#### 4. Example Files
- All `*pipeline.yaml` files → rename to `*bundle.yaml`
- Update content references within files

#### 5. Test Files
- Update test file names and test data
- Update assertions and error messages
- Update all test fixtures

#### 6. CLI Arguments
- `--pipeline` flag → `--bundle` flag (NO backward compatibility)
- Default filename: `pipeline.yaml` → `bundle.yaml`

### Search Patterns to Find
1. "pipeline manifest" → "bundle manifest" or "bundle"
2. "pipeline.yaml" → "bundle.yaml"
3. "PipelineManifest" → "BundleManifest"
4. "--pipeline" flag → "--bundle" flag
5. Comments/docstrings mentioning "pipeline" in bundle context
6. Import statements with pipeline_manifest
7. Variable names containing "pipeline" in bundle context

### Breaking Changes
- NO backward compatibility support
- All code must be updated in one change
- All examples must be updated
- All tests must be updated
- All documentation must be updated
- Users must update their manifests from `pipeline.yaml` to `bundle.yaml`

## Implementation Notes
- This is a breaking change requiring full migration
- Focus on clarity: bundle = what, GitHub workflows = how
- CICD teams own GitHub workflows
- Data/science teams own bundle definitions
- All references must be updated atomically
