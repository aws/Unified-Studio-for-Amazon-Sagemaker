Here are some Python best practices to help generative AI (GenAI) produce better, more efficient, and maintainable code:

1. Write Clear and Descriptive Prompts

Be specific about what you want the AI to generate. For example:

Instead of: "Write a function."
Use: "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion."


Include constraints, expected inputs/outputs, and edge cases.


2. Follow Pythonic Standards

Encourage adherence to PEP 8 (Python's style guide) for clean, readable code:

Use proper indentation (4 spaces per level).
Name variables and functions descriptively (e.g., calculate_sum instead of cs).
Limit line length to 79 characters.




3. Modularize Code

Request modular, reusable functions instead of monolithic scripts. For example:

"Create a function to validate email addresses and another to send emails."




4. Include Comments and Docstrings

Ask for meaningful comments and docstrings:

Example: "Add a docstring to explain the purpose of the function and its parameters."




5. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Request test cases alongside the code:

Example: "Write a function to sort a list and include unit tests using Python's unittest module."




6. Optimize for Performance

Specify performance expectations:

Example: "Write a function to find the largest prime factor of a number, optimized for large inputs."




7. Handle Errors Gracefully

Encourage robust error handling:

Example: "Add exception handling for invalid inputs using try and except blocks."




8. Use Type Hints

Request type annotations for better clarity and maintainability:def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
